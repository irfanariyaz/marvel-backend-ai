Generate structured slide content in JSON format based on the provided slide titles, topic, instructional level, and relevant context.

For each slide:

Topic: {topic}  
Instructional Level: {grade_level}  
Slide Titles: {outlines}  
Context: {context}  

- Strictly ensure that the text does not include any special formatting symbols like **, *, _, \n, or ~.
- Select the most appropriate template from the available options based on the content needs.
- Ensure content is concise, engaging, and aligned with the {grade_level}
- Avoid markdown formatting and line breaks (`\n`).
- Start the introductory slide with a welcoming tone. Briefly introduce the topic and its importance. Highlight the key areas that will be covered, such as core concepts and use cases.
- Keep the language simple, professional, and accessible for a general audience.
- Ensure that all slide content refers to and integrates relevant information from the context. If context does not cover a slide title, generate content based on general knowledge.
- When applicable, Incorporate real-world examples, case studies, or interactive elements  slides.

Create a visually engaging illustration for each slide with content about {topic}.

Step 1: Analyze the slide topic and instructional level. Consider:
- Topic domain (e.g., technology, business, science, humanities, arts)
- Target audience and context: {grade_level}
- Key concepts being presented

Step 2: Based on your analysis, determine the most appropriate visual style that would:
- Effectively communicate the content at the specified instructional level
- Engage the target audience appropriately
- Reflect the technical/conceptual complexity of the material
- Maintain visual interest while supporting learning objectives

Step 3: Create a detailed description of a high-quality 3D illustration in your selected style that includes:
- A clear visual metaphor or representation of the main concept
- Appropriate color palette and mood that aligns with the topic
- Level of detail appropriate for the instructional level (simpler for beginners, more complex for advanced)
- Visual elements that specifically reference these key terms
- Professional composition and lighting that enhances understanding
- Any text elements or data visualizations that would enhance comprehension
Ensure that the same visual styles/themes/ are maintained in throughout the  slides.
Specify explicitly what text should be presented in the image if present along with its details like the typography/position/style/. 
Any text included in the generated image must be concise, accurate, and directly relevant to the slide content and topic.
The final image should effectively communicate the essence of each slide while being visually striking and appropriate for the intended audience and instructional context.

Available templates:
- **titleAndBody**: Use for explanatory slides requiring well-structured, concise paragraphs.
- **titleAndBullets**: Use for a list of key takeaways, steps, or multiple points, ensuring clarity and brevity.

- **sectionHeader**: Use to introduce a new section.

Requirements:
- Ensure varied formatting to maintain engagement and visual appeal.
- Provide structured information that progressively builds understanding.
- **Explicitly reference and incorporate context into each slide's content.**
- If the context lacks details for a slide, supplement with general domain knowledge.
- Response should strictly follow this JSON format: {format_instructions}.
